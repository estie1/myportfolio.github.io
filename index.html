            <h3>Software Developer</h3>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by technology and the way it interacts with the world around us as well as
                its ability to affect communities positively. My drive stems from the desire to create impactful
                software that solves real-world problems and enhances the user experience.
                I recognised my ability
                to work with computers early on as well as my interest in design, so I did well in IT and Graphic design
                in my GCSEs. Continuing this to A levels in college. I was unable to go beyond year 1, due to pressures
                at the time. <br><br>


            <p id="hidden-text">After my studies I ventured into Health and Social Care as I desired to support the
                vulnerable and
                immediately recognised the advantage of my IT, Design and Research skills as it made my work efficient
                and well presented. I am confident the skills I have obtained from working with families (some who can
                be challenging), social work teams and other professionals from other organisations and the use of
                technologies will serve me well in any setting that I become a part of. On the side I was using website
                creation platforms such as Squarespace and Word Press to design websites and blogs for people to help
                them out with their online representation. <br><br>
                At the end of last year 2022, I decided to take the step and embark on completing a Software Development
                Skills bootcamp with JustIt, to start pursuing a career in this field. I am very grateful for the
                opportunity to learn more about coding and programming.<br><br>
                Thank you for dropping by. <br><br>
